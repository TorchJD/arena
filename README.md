# arena
This repo is used to compare different functions (like aggregators or backward calls), potentially from different commits of torchjd,
on a variety of topics (computation time, precision, etc.).

## Installation

We recommend to use Python 3.12, because earlier versions of torchjd did not support Python 3.13.
```bash
uv python install 3.12.10
uv python pin 3.12.10
```
